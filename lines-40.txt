# Input: The script reads lines from 
# stdin (e.g., piped input or a file 
# redirected to it).
# Output: It concatenates all input lines 
# into a single line, with the specified 
# separator (SEP) between each pair of 
# lines, and ends with a newline.
# Key Feature: The first line is printed 
# without a leading separator (since 
# awk_sep is initially empty), ensuring 
# no extra separator appears at the start.
# 
# # Set SEP to the first argument if 
# provided, otherwise default to ':'
# SEP="${1:-:}"
